# rekognition
## In this simple application we upload a pic and then we get to recognize whether there is male female in picture and the age range , emotions ,whether they wear eyeglass or not , any facial hair they have like beard.
### i have added whether the added picture is celebrity or not. if they are their name will be displayed else they are not celebrity will be displayed.
There is one issue as image fetched from s3 bucket is not displayed.

here i used 

        Flask 
        HTML/CSS
        boto3
        

usage

         $git clone https://github.com/Mausamadhikari/rekognition.git

         $python -m venv venv 
         $source venv/bin/activate
